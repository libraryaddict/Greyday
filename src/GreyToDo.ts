// Use melodramy for desert, grab ornate dowsing rod
// Centralize a bunch of calls, make checking if we have absorbs easier
// Use other key sources
// Calculate if we should melee or spell damage properly for orcs
// Improve aboo checking, including if we can finish all the thing before trying to go there.
// Remove umbrella requirements, remove other iotm must have requirements
// Use other banishers
// Use backups in quest zones
// Don't spend vacation when we're unlocking dungeons of doom
// Avoid adventure burning places if we're running +familiar exp, eg: vacation, vacation papers, and some other place I forget
// Consider doing filthworms early if we have nanovision and need to burn turns
// Centralize pulls better and do early pulls if possible
// Provide some kind of plan to display to the user for debug reasons
// Use other familiars if we can
// When we're trying to hit item drop, don't try to level up other fams
// Run delay burners in more zones
// Pull the WAND items if we have enough pulls and lack those items + would lose adventures (Though that should be farmed already)
// Use emit dupes more? Would require better planning for absorbs though
// Possibly delay kitchen until we can prove we have enough resist or we're too far ahead that this is going to slow us down
// For stat checks (blech house, contestents) switch between all equip holding fams, and check if there's fams that'd give us an advantage
// Try retrocape for the tower shadow, try more fights against the witch than just double nano..
// Add a debug command to see if there's absorbs remaining, and where. Also their turns gained.
// Support more worksheds
// Maybe use more lockets / wishes
// Maybe use bowling ball for more than just bowling alley + bowl straight up
// Maybe use daylight shavings buffs somehow
// Use candles and other potions
// Use pocket professor copier?
// Better outfit creation
// Use saber's force
// Use melodramy copiers maybe? May need to pull helmet
// Use all pulls as feasible, add notes on how many turns each pull saves
// Maybe use the vampire cloak, esp for nuns and maybe kitchen
// Use doctor's bag specials?
// Do boxing day buff? Though it's not remarkable
// Equip latte, esp for certain zones that gives you drinks. Such as +pvp fights
// Use NEP's free fights & buffs
// Do bastille?
// Use locked mumming trunk
// Use suspicious package
// Bunch of more free fight iotms meh
// Source Terminal? Sounds annoying.
// Do librams / grimoires
// Can of rain doh
// Free runs fams - meh
// Hmm, do free kills to YR mobs earlier?
// Potentially try to unlock dungeons of doom easier / absorb +mp mobs
// spooky putty? Forgot what it does
// Maybe stuffing fluffers, look at loopcasual to see what dirty tricks it pulls
// Use kramco when its ready and there's no zones that wants it
