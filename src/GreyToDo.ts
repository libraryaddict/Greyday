// Centralize a bunch of calls, make checking if we have absorbs easier
// Use other key sources
// Calculate if we should melee or spell damage properly for orcs
// Improve aboo checking, including if we can finish all the thing before trying to go there.
// Use other banishers
// Use backups in quest zones
// Consider doing filthworms early if we have nanovision and need to burn turns
// Use other familiars if we can
// When we're trying to hit item drop, don't try to level up other fams
// Use emit dupes more? Would require better planning for absorbs though
// Possibly delay kitchen until we can prove we have enough resist or we're too far ahead that this is going to slow us down
// Support more worksheds
// Maybe use daylight shavings buffs somehow
// Use candles and other potions
// Use pocket professor copier?
// Use melodramy copiers maybe? May need to pull helmet
// Maybe use the vampire cloak, esp for nuns and maybe kitchen
// Use doctor's bag specials?
// Do boxing day buff? Though it's not remarkable
// Use suspicious package
// Bunch of more free fight iotms meh
// Source Terminal? Sounds annoying.
// Do librams / grimoires
// Can of rain doh
// Free runs fams - meh
// Hmm, do free kills to YR mobs earlier?
// Potentially try to unlock dungeons of doom easier / absorb +mp mobs
// spooky putty? Forgot what it does
// Maybe stuffing fluffers, look at loopcasual to see what dirty tricks it pulls
// Use kramco when its ready and there's no zones that wants it
// Pull some source of infinite free runs and run whenever it's a fight we don't care about
// Level up camel when we can, which if we're running lots of +fam exp, is often. Delay zones that'd like that spit. Mountain Man, Middle Pyramid, Goat Cheese, Lobster, sonar?, giants for their mohawk/amulet?, enchanted bean?, stephen?, stars, white pixel, evil eye, funky junk key?, filth worms glands?, bowler?, glark cables?, cig lighter?, crappy disguise?, stone wool?, bitchin car?, knob perfume? Rusty hedge trimmers
// Adjust familiar weight bonus based on how soon we're going to need it
// Smart banishers, such as some method to get number of available banishers and if banishers will be available in the future.
// Create some kind of earmark system where quests/tasks can preregister what resources/meat they need. So I can burn resources on optional stuff without worrying about interfering with something else

// Convert quest status to 'READY' 'NOT READY' 'COMPLETED'. And add subquest status to 'READY' where it can declare a priority over other stuff.
// Use crystal ball to fish for non-absorbs monsters that we want and where spending turns in the zone benifits no one. Such as blur, the +meat plant. We can switch to other zones that want progression and cost us nothing in resources to spend away
