// Use melodramy for desert, grab ornate dowsing rod
// Centralize a bunch of calls, make checking if we have absorbs easier
// Use other key sources
// Calculate if we should melee or spell damage properly for orcs
// Improve aboo checking, including if we can finish all the thing before trying to go there.
// Remove umbrella requirements, remove other iotm must have requirements

// Use other familiars if we can
// When we're trying to hit item drop, don't try to level up other fams
// Run delay burners in more zones
// Pull the WAND items if we have enough pulls and lack those items + would lose adventures (Though that should be farmed already)
// Use emit dupes more? Would require better planning for absorbs though
// Possibly delay kitchen until we can prove we have enough resist or we're too far ahead that this is going to slow us down
// For stat checks (blech house, contestents) switch between all equip holding fams, and check if there's fams that'd give us an advantage
// Try retrocape for the tower shadow, try more fights against the witch than just double nano..
// Add a debug command to see if there's absorbs remaining, and where. Also their turns gained.
// Support more worksheds
// Maybe use more lockets / wishes
// Maybe use bowling ball for more than just bowling alley + bowl straight up

// spooky putty? Forgot what it does
// Maybe stuffing fluffers, look at loopcasual to see what dirty tricks it pulls
// Use kramco when its ready and there's no zones that wants it
// Pull some source of infinite free runs and run whenever it's a fight we don't care about
// Level up camel when we can, which if we're running lots of +fam exp, is often. Delay zones that'd like that spit. Mountain Man, Middle Pyramid, Goat Cheese, Lobster, sonar?, giants for their mohawk/amulet?, enchanted bean?, stephen?, stars, white pixel, evil eye, funky junk key?, filth worms glands?, bowler?, glark cables?, cig lighter?, crappy disguise?, stone wool?, bitchin car?, knob perfume? Rusty hedge trimmers
// Adjust familiar weight bonus based on how soon we're going to need it
// Don't bowl straight up all the time
// Smart banishers, such as some method to get number of available banishers and if banishers will be available in the future.
// Create some kind of earmark system where quests/tasks can preregister what resources/meat they need. So I can burn resources on optional stuff without worrying about interfering with something else
// Use pocket wishes for absorbs
// Investigate why it would do "Visit Oil Baron, hit introduction, decide to go somewhere else, hit another introduction, go back to oil". It should just try again.

// Look at wishing in stuff
// YR the frat boy instead of pulling, wish, locket or cargo shorts him
