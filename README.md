Script for grey me

Be sure to check out the other grey you script! Currently, that script will perform better for the majority of players.

https://github.com/Kasekopf/loop-casual/tree/gyou

The following commands are supported.

`grey requirements` - tells you what this script needs to run

`grey sim` - Prepares to run grey you, without running it

`grey run` - Runs one turn, then exits

`grey run <turns>` - Runs <turns> turns, then exits

**Installation**

Installation of this script is fairly easy.
To try this script, use this command in Mafia's CLI

```text
svn checkout https://github.com/libraryaddict/KolLocket/branches/release/
```

**Moon Signs**

You can pick whatever moon sign you like, all the areas should be supported.
Though I personally pick gnomes so that the script will pick up Torso Awareness.
Does it help? Probably not, shirts kinda suck.

If you are low IOTM, then picking Marmot may be the best idea for the +1 res. This is mainly helpful for Ice Peak, Haunted Kitchen, A-Boo Peak and a few other tests.
If you have low progression in this path, picking Vole is a decent idea for the extra MP and HP.

I myself pick Blender, for the extra 5 adventures when drinking booze. It only takes effect when I choose a normal class however.

**Workshed**

Your workshed also doesn't matter\* but there are some notes.

In Hardcore, your Cold Medicine Cabinet will be used to grab a few pieces of equipment.
The remaining uses, or all of them in softcore. Your Cold Medicine Cabinet will be used to grab Extrovermectinâ„¢ whenever available.

Your Asdon Martin will be used, but notably the only ways it currently uses the Asdon Martin is for the banishes and for +meat when doing nuns.

I myself like to use Asdon Martin for my runs, then when I break prism. Buff myself with a thousand turns of +meat for garbo, then switch to Cold Medicine Cabinet.
The next day before I ascend into Grey You, I switch back to Asdon Martin.

**Required IOTMs**

This is non-negotiable. There are other iotms you should check out in the script, but the key iotms you must have are as follows.
Please note that your experience may still be shit without the other iotms.

- Grey Goose - Why even play this path without it
- VIP Invitation - We use Fortune Teller, Hot Tub and the Fireworks Shop. I could make this optional, but this is an iotm I think you should grab.
